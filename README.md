## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This time I tried using CSS variables for color, which makes it really easy to change the color later if needed.

Also had to study how to make the eye overlay on hover effect, since the images needed to be overlapping it was a bit challenging to do at first. I went a step further and tried to make the image expand on click, but since it needed JS and I wanted to stick with just HTML and CSS, I ended up using `active`. It was not ideal since you have to maintain left mouse click pressed, but it did the trick.
